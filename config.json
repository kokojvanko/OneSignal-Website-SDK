/*
  Purpose: Configuration file for OneSignal web SDK build process and tests runner

  Description:

  The tests execute in a browser environment, but a NodeJS test server runs side by side to facilitate database access
  and perform other commands (e.g. possibly mouse clicks in the future) that would not be possible inside of a
  browser's sandbox environment.

  This configuration file is first requested before the tests begin running.
